This will be my ongoing repository for tryhackme/hackthebox/etc. write-ups. This will also be an opportunity for me to learn version control outside of the strictly
hypothetical I know right now. I will be citing sources and while I cannot say for certain, odds are good that these will be more informal write-ups for my own purposes.

I will also use this space to create simulated reports as if each room or machine were a paid pentesting engagement.
